Development Notes 
(SF notes to self about remoras and order of functions)

initialize.m
- sets up the pull down menu. use 'Callback' to reference an action in _pulldown.m to make something happen. 

_pulldown.m
- function that outlines possible 'actions' triggered by selection of something in the pulldown menu, then calls new functions for those actions. 
*for now just 1 action possible here. 
	action is: batch_ltsas
	- this triggers setting up the GUI figure (_init_batch_figure.m), some initial settings (_init_settings.m), and then the actual gui (_init_batch_gui.m)

_init_figure.m
- defines GUI figure size, position, color, etc. 

init_settings.m
- define some initial LTSA, filetype, directory settings

_init_gui.m
- gui for setting up the batch LTSA creation (using _init_figure.m settings)
- set directory to look for sound files, file type, and LTSA settings for all (or at least most of the directories...can change 1 by 1 later)
- lots of manual arrangement of how the GUI looks
- each button or text box calls an ACTION in batchLTSA_control

_control.m
- defines various actions that happen based on different interactions with the GUI. Most set variables or call basic MATLAB functions. 
- Only RUN button at bottom calls another Remora function (batchLTSA_init_batch_LTSA.m

_init_batch_ltsa.m
- displays a message and runs the actual precheck and batch LTSA functions
*this is really small...maybe unnecessary/could be combined with control above? 

_mk_batch_ltsa_precheck.m
- check the input data is as is it should be and confirm ltsa settings
- this calls another gui (batchLTSA_ltsa_params.m) where settings can be updated. 
- this was originally included in _mk_ltsa_batch but pulled it out to make a bit easier to modify for multi-channel/not have a 300+ line function

_mk_batch_ltsa.m
- actually make LTSAs, looping through multiple directories! 

_mk_ltsa_dir.m
- make LTSA for a single directory

_calc_LTSA_dir.m
- calculate an LTSA slice for above.
