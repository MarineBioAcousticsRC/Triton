TEST TEST,"To understand natural and anthropogenic sound in the ocean, and to compare underwater soundscapes globally, standard methods of analysis must be applied to passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) data. Methods that balance constrained volume and adequate resolution of acoustic spectra have recently been published (Martin et al., 2021a,b). A community effort supported by NOAA, BOEM, U.S. Navy, and ONR was initiated to apply these methods to PAM datasets from around the world. This record represents the hybrid millidecade band (HMB) spectra of sound levels derived from calibrated PAM data. Daily HMB spectra at 1 minute resolution were created using the TriHyb in Triton (vXXX).","Data analysis was performed using the TriHyb Remora in Triton, to produce HMD spectra of sound levels from oceanic audio recordings. Processing utilized MATLAB code provided as supplemental material in Martin et al. (2021b). Power spectral density (PSD) levels were computed from 1-minute segments of audio data. Frequency-dependent calibrations are included in the HMD. By applying fast Fourier transform (FFT) with length equal to the sample rate, using Hann window and 50% overlap, PSD estimates (V^2/Hz) were computed with a frequency resolution of 1 Hz and a temporal resolution of 1 second. The 1 second PSD estimates from each 1-minute segment were averaged, and the average spectrum for each minute was further processed to an HMD spectrum following Martin et al. (2021b).",,Original hybrid millidecade spectra were produced by the Marine Bioacoustics Research Collaborative (MBARC),The original audio recordings were supported by the Southern California Ocean Observing System.,"oceans, ocean acoustics, ambient noise, intensity, marine environment monitoring, marine habitat, sound_intensity_level_in_water, soundscapes",GCMD Science Keywords,CC-BY4.0,The hydrophone at 585 meters depth and is tethered approximately 10 meters above the seafloor. ,Vanessa ZoBell,Postdoctoral Researcher,https://mbarc.ucsd.edu/,"Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California, San Diego",https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/passive-acoustic-data,High-frequency Acoustic Recording Package,"Hybrid millidecade band processing followed Martin et al.
