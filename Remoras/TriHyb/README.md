# TriHyb: Triton-based Hybrid Millidecade Products

**TriHyb** is a [Triton](https://github.com/MarineBioAcousticsRC/Triton)-compatible Remora developed to compute **Hybrid Millidecade (HMD)** soundscape products, as described in Martin et al. (2021). These minutely-resolution products follow standards established by NOAA's [National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI)](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/), and enable detailed analysis of long-term underwater soundscapes.

## üöÄ Key Features

- Computes **minutely power spectral density (PSD)** data.
- Generates **daily netCDF** files for long-term acoustic archives.
- Provides visualization-ready data products.
- Supports flexible **frequency band selection** (e.g., 10‚Äì4000 Hz).
- Built-in GUI tabs for **metadata entry** and **HMD computation**.
- Integrated as a **Remora** within the Triton PAM software suite.

## üß≠ Use Cases

- Identify sound sources (e.g., ships, marine mammals, fish, environmental noise).
- Study temporal trends in underwater soundscapes.
- Compare soundscapes across different sites and deployments.
- Quantify acoustic habitat conditions and anthropogenic impact.
