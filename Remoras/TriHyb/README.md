# TriHyb: Triton-based Hybrid Millidecade Products

**TriHyb** is a [Triton](https://github.com/MarineBioAcousticsRC/Triton)-compatible Remora developed to compute **Hybrid Millidecade (HMD)** soundscape products, as described in Martin et al. (2021). These minutely-resolution products follow standards established by NOAA's [National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI)](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/), and enable detailed analysis of long-term underwater soundscapes.

## üöÄ Key Features

- Computes **minutely hybrid-millidecade** (HMD) soundscape products.
- Generates **daily netCDF** files for long-term acoustic archives.
- Provides visualization-ready data products.
- Built-in GUI tabs for **metadata entry** and **HMD computation**.
- Integrated as a **Remora** within the Triton PAM software suite.

---

## üß≠ Use Cases

- Study temporal trends in underwater soundscapes.
- Identify sound sources (e.g., ships, marine mammals, fish, environmental noise).
- Compare soundscapes across different sites and deployments.
- Quantify acoustic habitat conditions and anthropogenic impact.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### 1. Clone or Download Triton + TriHyb

Clone the Triton repository and the TriHyb Remora:

Then, place the TriHyb Remora inside the `Remoras/` directory of Triton.

### 2. Add TriHyb to Triton

Follow the instructions in the [Quick Setup Guide](https://github.com/MarineBioAcousticsRC/Triton/wiki/Quick-Setup#step-4-add-remoras) to add the TriHyb Remora to your Triton GUI.

## üß™ How to Use

### Launch TriHyb

1. Open Triton.  
2. From the **Remoras** menu, select `TriHyb > Compute HMD Products`.

This opens a tabbed GUI with the following sections:

### ‚öôÔ∏è Compute HMD Tab

Configure the HMD processing options:
- `Input Directory`, `Filename Pattern`, `Output Directory`,
- `Transfer Function File`, `Organization`, `Deployment`  
- `Start Date`, `End Date`, `Start Frequency`, `End Frequency`  
- `Project`, `Site Name`, `Site Location`  
- `Start Frequency`, `End Frequency`  
- `Minimum Effort for Minute Bin`

Check **"Search Subfolders"** to include multiple disks in a deployment.
